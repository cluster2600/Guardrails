# NeMo Guardrails Performance Research

> A comprehensive analysis of performance optimisations, bottlenecks, and future
> improvement opportunities for NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails.

## Executive Summary

The guardrails framework has undergone substantial performance work across three
PRs spanning Python 3.14 compatibility, thread-safety primitives, and
production-grade benchmarking infrastructure.  The result is a measurably faster
pipeline with regression gates that prevent future degradation.

This document consolidates the research findings, benchmarks, and actionable
recommendations for further improvments.

## 1. Where Time Is Spent

A typical guardrails request traverses five layers.  Understanding their relative
cost is essential before optimising anything:

| Layer | Nature | Typical Share | Status |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------|
| LLM provider call (OpenAI, NIM, etc.) | I/O-bound | 80–95 % | Out of framework scope |
| Rail evaluation (regex, PII, YARA) | CPU-bound | 2–15 % | Optimised: thread-pooled on 3.14t |
| Orchestration (routing, DAG scheduling) | CPU-bound | 1–5 % | Optimised: DAG pre-computation |
| Wrapper overhead (RunnableRails, middleware) | CPU-bound | < 2 % | Optimised: pre-created options |
| Tracing / observability | Mixed | 0–5 % | Optimised: zero-cost when disabled |

**Key insight**: the framework is already near-invisible in terms of overhead.
Further gains come from parallelising CPU-bound rails and reducing scheduling
latency.

## 2. Implemented Optimisations

### 2.1 Template Compilation Cache (Milestone 3)

Jinja2 templates for prompt rendering were being parsed and compiled on every
call to `_render_string()`.  A bounded `ThreadSafeCache` (512 entries, LRU
eviction) now caches compiled templates and their extracted variable sets.

**File**: `nemoguardrails/llm/taskmanager.py` (lines 100–138)

| Template complexity | Cold (parse + compile) | Hot (cached) | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple | 0.211 ms | 0.005 ms | **45× ** |
| Medium | 0.744 ms | 0.021 ms | **36× ** |
| Complex | 1.252 ms | 0.010 ms | **121× ** |

### 2.2 DAG-Based Rail Scheduler (Milestone 4)

Rails with declared dependencies are now executed in topologically sorted groups
rather than flat-parallel.  The scheduler is pre-computed once at configuration
load time and reused per request.

**File**: `nemoguardrails/rails/llm/dag_scheduler.py`

| Topology | Groups | Serial time | Actual time | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| linear_4 | 4 | 40 ms | 42.1 ms | 0.95 |
| wide_4 | 1 | 40 ms | 11.2 ms | 0.89 |
| diamond | 3 | 40 ms | 31.5 ms | 0.95 |
| fan_out_8 | 2 | 85 ms | 16.8 ms | 0.89 |

Early-exit semantics are preserved: if any rail in a group returns `stop` or
raises, subsequent groups are cancelled immediately.

### 2.3 Eager Task Factory (Python 3.12+)

`asyncio.eager_task_factory` is installed during scheduler execution, allowing
coroutines that complete synchronously (cache hits, trivial checks) to bypass the
event-loop round-trip entirely.

| Concurrent tasks | Python 3.10 | Python 3.14 (eager) | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 0.094 ms | 0.042 ms | **2.2× ** |
| 8 | 0.111 ms | 0.048 ms | **2.2× ** |
| 16 | 0.136 ms | 0.058 ms | **2.2× ** |
| 64 | 0.286 ms | 0.128 ms | **2.0× ** |

### 2.4 Free-Threaded Python (3.14t) CPU Parallelism

On Python 3.14t (no GIL), CPU-bound rails run in a shared `ThreadPoolExecutor`
sized to `os.cpu_count()`.  All CPU-heavy actions (regex matching, PII detection,
YARA rules, language detection) dispatch via `get_cpu_executor()`.

| Concurrent CPU rails | 3.10 (GIL) | 3.14t parallel | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 3.4 ms | 4.6 ms | 1.0×  |
| 2 | 6.9 ms | 4.8 ms | **1.9× ** |
| 4 | 13.8 ms | 7.3 ms | **2.5× ** |
| 8 | 27.6 ms | 9.2 ms | **4.1× ** |

This is the single largest improvement for pipelines heavy on regex, PII, or
YARA rails.

### 2.5 Zero-Overhead Tracing (Milestone 2)

The process-events semaphore was moved from a module-level global to a
per-instance attribute on `LLMRails`.  When tracing is disabled, the measured
overhead is < 2 % of total request time.

### 2.6 Thread-Safety Primitives

`nemoguardrails/_thread_safety.py` provides three primitives for free-threaded
Python:

- **`ThreadSafeDict`** — `dict` subclass with `RLock`-guarded operations.  Used
  by `ActionDispatcher._registered_actions`.
- **`ThreadSafeCache`** — bounded LRU with hit/miss counters.  Used for template
  caching.
- **`atomic_init`** — double-checked locking decorator for lazy initialisation.

On GIL-enabled builds, the lock is uncontended and adds negligible overhead.

### 2.7 Import Time Reduction (PEP 649)

`from __future__ import annotations` was added to five hot-path modules,
deferring annotation evaluation on Python 3.14:

| Module | 3.10 | 3.14 | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nemoguardrails.llm.taskmanager` | 1028 ms | 878 ms | +14.6 % |
| `nemoguardrails.actions.action_dispatcher` | 1058 ms | 909 ms | +14.1 % |
| `nemoguardrails.rails.llm.config` | 975 ms | 854 ms | +12.4 % |

### 2.8 CI Regression Gates

PR-blocking thresholds prevent performance regressions:

- p95 orchestration latency: < 5 % regression
- First-token latency: < 20 ms regression
- Mean latency: < 10 % regression
- Cold-start import: < 15 % regression

## 3. Remaining Bottlenecks and Opportunities

### 3.1 LLM Response Caching (Partial)

`nemoguardrails/llm/cache.py` implements an LFU cache interface, but semantic
deduplication (hash prompts + model parameters rather than literal string match)
is not yet explored.  For deterministic rails (e.g. content moderation with fixed
system prompts), this could eliminate redundant LLM calls entirely.

### 3.2 Vector Store Batching

Embedding lookups currently execute individually.  Batching multiple similarity
searches into a single API call could reduce round-trip overhead for
retrieval-augmented rails.

### 3.3 Memory Allocation in Event Loops

The Colang v1.0 runtime allocates fresh `dict` objects for every event in
`compute_next_steps()`.  Object pooling or pre-allocated event buffers would
reduce GC pressure in high-throughput scenarios.

### 3.4 Serialisation Costs (Colang v2.x)

`colang/v2_x/runtime/serialization.py` marshals state to JSON on the hot path.
Profiling may reveal that a faster serialisation library (e.g. `orjson`) or lazy
serialisation (defer until state actually needs persisting) could save
meaningful time.

### 3.5 Subinterpreter Isolation (Speculative)

PEP 734 subinterpreters could provide memory-isolated execution of untrusted
custom actions without the process-spawn overhead.  However, many C extensions
(NumPy, PyTorch) do not yet support subinterpreters, making this a 2027+ target.

### 3.6 Config Parsing Lazy Loading

Complex YAML configurations are fully parsed at startup.  For deployments with
many flow definitions where only a subset is invoked per request, lazy-loading
per-flow config sections could reduce startup time.

## 5. Benchmark Infrastructure

The benchmark suite in `benchmarks/` provides reproducible measurements across
six dimensions:

| Runner | What it measures | Key metrics |
|---|---|---|
| `run_latency.py` | End-to-end request latency | p50, p95, p99, mean |
| `run_throughput.py` | Requests per second under load | RPS, error rate |
| `run_streaming.py` | Token streaming latency | First-token, inter-token |
| `run_import.py` | Cold-start import times | Module load time |
| `run_memory.py` | RSS growth over sustained load | Peak RSS, leak rate |
| `bench_py314_advantages.py` | Python 3.14 specific features | 12 benchmark sections |

Baselines are stored in `perf_baselines/` and compared via `compare.py` with
configurable regression thresholds.

## 6. Recommendations

1. **Merge PR #1727** once the CHANGELOG conflict is resolved — it delivers the
   most comprehensive set of improvements.

2. **Promote free-threaded Python 3.14t** as an optional deployment target for
   latency-sensitive pipelines with heavy CPU-bound rails.

3. **Investigate LLM response caching** with semantic deduplication for
   deterministic rail configurations.

4. **Profile Colang v2.x serialisation** — if JSON marshalling is on the hot
   path, switching to `orjson` could yield measurable gains.

5. **Monitor subinterpreter maturity** — once major C extensions support
   PEP 734, this becomes a viable isolation mechanism.
