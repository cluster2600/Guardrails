"""Compatibility shim for langchain on Python 3.14+ (PEP 649).

Python 3.14 introduces PEP 649 (deferred evaluation of annotations).
Under PEP 649, pydantic resolves type annotations using vars(cls),
which means a class method named ``dict()`` shadows the builtin
``dict`` type.  langchain 0.3.x defines ``Chain.dict()`` and similar
methods, so ``dict[str, Any]`` annotations resolve to the *method*
rather than the builtin — raising ``TypeError: 'function' object is
not subscriptable``.

The fix landed in langchain 1.x (``langchain-classic``) via
langchain-ai/langchain#33575, which explicitly uses ``builtins.dict``
in annotations.  This module provides a workaround for environments
still running langchain 0.3.x on Python >= 3.14.

    module's namespace *before* pydantic triggers annotation evaluation,
    we prevent methods like ``Chain.dict()`` from shadowing them.

    This must be called **before** any langchain class that defines a

    times -- already-patched modules are skipped via a sentinel attribute.
